# ToDo App with React and Vite

This project is a basic ToDo application built using React and Vite, showcasing state management and local storage integration in React. The app allows users to add, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks, all while persisting data in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**:
  Users can input new tasks, which are added to the task list and saved in local storage for persistence.

- **Mark Tasks as Complete**:
  Tasks can be toggled between "completed" and "incomplete" states. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a different style.

- **Delete Tasks**:
  Users can remove tasks from the list. Changes are immediately reflected in local storage.

- **Data Persistence**:
  Tasks persist even after refreshing or closing the browser, thanks to local storage integration.

- **User-Friendly UI**:
  The application features a clean Bootstrap-based interface with intuitive controls.
